Enrollment criteria were aged 16 to 38 months, healthy, English- or Spanish-speaking caregiver, and toddler able to sit and view the app. Participants were screened with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-Revised With Follow-up during routine care. Children were referred by their pediatrician for diagnostic evaluation based on results of the checklist or if the caregiver or pediatrician was concerned.

A cortical network involving the inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, and amygdala underlies perception of facial features and expressions, which interacts with regions involving reward, such as the ventral striatum, contributing to attentional preferences. Infants' early attention to other people promotes learning about the social world through interaction with others. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by decreased spontaneous visual attention to social stimuli, evident by 6 months of age. Diminished social visual engagement with others influences the early development of social brain circuitry and has been hypothesized to contribute to later deficits in social and communicative abilities associated with autism. Early intervention that promotes social engagement can potentially mitigate the cascading effects of reduced social attention on brain and behavioral development, leading to improved outcomes. Thus, there is a need for reliable, feasible methods for measuring gaze to facilitate early ASD detection."

When 2 clusters are compact and far from each other, the distance to the neighbors in the same cluster will be smaller than the distance to samples outside of the cluster, leading to maximal silhouette score.

Eye-gaze data can be collected from toddlers sitting on a caregiver's lap in pediatric clinics and quantified without any training, special setup, equipment, or calibration. Strategically designed, brief movies, shown on a tablet or smartphone, elicited distinctive patterns of gaze in toddlers with ASD, characterized by reduced preference for social stimuli, lower attentional focus on salient social segments of the movie, and previously unknown deficits in the ability to coordinate their gaze with the speech sounds of others. These results have broad scientific and clinical implications for human behavioral research. They open vast possibilities for gathering large data sets on eye-tracking biomarkers in real-world settings, amenable to big data analysis and machine learning, and applicable to a wide range of psychiatric and medical conditions characterized by atypical gaze patterns.[28,29]"
