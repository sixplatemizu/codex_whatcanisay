Caregivers of 1564 toddlers were invited to participate during a well-child visit. A total of 993 toddlers (63%) completed study measures. Enrollment criteria were aged 16 to 38 months, healthy, English- or Spanish-speaking caregiver, and toddler able to sit and view the app. Participants were screened with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-Revised With Follow-up during routine care. Children were referred by their pediatrician for diagnostic evaluation based on results of the checklist or if the caregiver or pediatrician was concerned. Forty toddlers subsequently were diagnosed with ASD."

A cortical network involving the inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, and amygdala underlies perception of facial features and expressions, which interacts with regions involving reward, such as the ventral striatum, contributing to attentional preferences. Infants' early attention to other people promotes learning about the social world through interaction with others. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by decreased spontaneous visual attention to social stimuli, evident by 6 months of age. Diminished social visual engagement with others influences the early development of social brain circuitry and has been hypothesized to contribute to later deficits in social and communicative abilities associated with autism. Early intervention that promotes social engagement can potentially mitigate the cascading effects of reduced social attention on brain and behavioral development, leading to improved outcomes. Thus, there is a need for reliable, feasible methods for measuring gaze to facilitate early ASD detection."

The movies were strategically designed to assess social attention based on a priori hypotheses. No calibration, special equipment, or controlled environment was needed. We demonstrated that this tool reliably measures both known and novel social attention gaze biomarkers that distinguish toddlers with ASD vs typical development."

The Otsu20 method was used on the valid-gaze horizontal coordinate and split the gaze data into 2 clusters (left and right). A silhouette score was used to assess the significance of the clusters.21 This measure compares the distance of samples within the same cluster with the distance to the neighbors in a different cluster. When 2 clusters are compact and far from each other, the distance to the neighbors in the same cluster will be smaller than the distance to samples outside of the cluster, leading to maximal silhouette score. The clustering measure range is -1 to 1; the closer the measure is to 1, the stronger the separation and definition of the clusters."

We compared the performance of simple tree classifiers using the gaze features from individual movies and combined across movies. We fit the models to evaluate the accuracy of discrimination between ASD vs typical development. Figure 5 presents the receiver operating characteristic curves and AUC obtained for models trained for individual gaze features and their combination. The receiver operating characteristic shows the proportion of children with typical development incorrectly classified in the ASD group vs the proportion of children in the ASD group correctly classified as being diagnosed with ASD."

When these features were combined, AUC performance increased to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.97). eTable 2 in the Supplement provides the AUCs obtained for the models based on combining gaze features separately by sex and racial/ethnic background. The AUC values remained relatively consistent for these subgroups; however, CIs were larger owing to smaller samples."

Eye-gaze data can be collected from toddlers sitting on a caregiver's lap in pediatric clinics and quantified without any training, special setup, equipment, or calibration. Strategically designed, brief movies, shown on a tablet or smartphone, elicited distinctive patterns of gaze in toddlers with ASD, characterized by reduced preference for social stimuli, lower attentional focus on salient social segments of the movie, and previously unknown deficits in the ability to coordinate their gaze with the speech sounds of others. These results have broad scientific and clinical implications for human behavioral research. They open vast possibilities for gathering large data sets on eye-tracking biomarkers in real-world settings, amenable to big data analysis and machine learning, and applicable to a wide range of psychiatric and medical conditions characterized by atypical gaze patterns.[28,29]"

Receiver operating characteristics appear nonsmooth due to the small number of levels in the model. On the right, the per-feature classification boundaries associated with the gaze features extracted from each movie are shown, as automatically computed by the classification strategy. A shallow tree was used to learn to classify from the data; the portions of the feature space associated with a higher risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are shown colored."
