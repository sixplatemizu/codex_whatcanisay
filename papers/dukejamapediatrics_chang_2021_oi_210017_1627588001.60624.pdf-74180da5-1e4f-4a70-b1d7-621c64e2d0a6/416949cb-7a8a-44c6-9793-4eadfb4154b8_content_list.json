A cortical network involving the inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, and amygdala underlies perception of facial features and expressions, which interacts with regions involving reward, such as the ventral striatum, contributing to attentional preferences. Infants' early attention to other people promotes learning about the social world through interaction with others. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by decreased spontaneous visual attention to social stimuli, evident by 6 months of age. Diminished social visual engagement with others influences the early development of social brain circuitry and has been hypothesized to contribute to later deficits in social and communicative abilities associated with autism. Early intervention that promotes social engagement can potentially mitigate the cascading effects of reduced social attention on brain and behavioral development, leading to improved outcomes. Thus, there is a need for reliable, feasible methods for measuring gaze to facilitate early ASD detection.",

        "text": "We demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that an app deployed on relatively low-cost, widely available devices can reliably measure gaze and detect early ASD symptoms related to social attention. Eye-gaze data can be collected from toddlers sitting on a caregiver's lap in pediatric clinics and quantified without any training, special setup, equipment, or calibration. Strategically designed, brief movies, shown on a tablet or smartphone, elicited distinctive patterns of gaze in toddlers with ASD, characterized by reduced preference for social stimuli, lower attentional focus on salient social segments of the movie, and previously unknown deficits in the ability to coordinate their gaze with the speech sounds of others. These results have broad scientific and clinical implications for human behavioral research. They open vast possibilities for gathering large data sets on eye-tracking biomarkers in real-world settings, amenable to big data analysis and machine learning, and applicable to a wide range of psychiatric and medical conditions characterized by atypical gaze patterns.[28,29]",

Although any one feature showed overlap between toddlers with and without ASD, a computational approach was used to measure and integrate multiple features, obtaining significantly lower overlap between the groups. We plan to combine multiple gaze features with other behavioral features that can be measured with computer vision analysis using the same app, such as facial expressions, $^{30,31}$  response to name, $^{32,33}$  and sensorimotor behaviors. $^{34}$  Because these behaviors develop during the first year of postnatal life, this approach could detect ASD risk behaviors during infancy.",
